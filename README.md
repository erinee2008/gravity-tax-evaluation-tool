# Gravity Tax Evaluation Tool

## Overview
This tool is designed for therapists and researchers to quantify the **Gravity Tax** on the human body. Based on the research in *The Fractal Series* by Erin Fulks, this application identifies "invisible" structural resistance that can delay or stop developmental milestones.

## How it Works
By aggregating data across three clinical evaluation factors—**Rotation**, **Structural**, and **Weight Transfer**—the tool calculates a unique stress gradient. 

### Key Features
* **Gravity Tax Calculation**: A 0.0 to 1.0 scale determining developmental deviations and risk.
* **Cumulative Stress Ranking**: Identifies the specific body parts (e.g., Spine, Eyes, Gut) under the most strain.
* **Milestone Analysis**: Pinpoints which movements are facing the highest gravitational resistance.
* **Therapist Action Plan**: Generates a prioritized intervention strategy based on cumulative data.

## Usage
1. Input the overarching totals from the physical evaluation sheets.
2. Enter the finite percentage deficits for body parts and milestones.
3. Generate the report to see the ranked stress gradient and download the CSV.
